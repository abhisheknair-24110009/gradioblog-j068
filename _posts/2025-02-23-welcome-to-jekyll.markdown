##  üìÑ Introduction

Gradio is a powerful Python library that lets users quickly create interactive web-based interfaces for your machine learning models or any Python functions. It makes it easy to test, showcase, and share your models with others, while also supporting a variety of input and output types like text, images, and audio. Gradio allows for real-time interaction, with live input-output updates, making it easy to see instant feedback. You can also customize the interface to make it visually appealing and integrate it seamlessly with popular machine learning libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch. Plus, it offers simple deployment, letting you share your work with a broader audience effortlessly.  

Gradio interfaces can be easily shared, either by hosting them locally or using third party software such as Huggingface Spaces. Gradio apps can also be integrated with external applications using its API endpoint. This allows Gradio apps to be integrated with websites and other apps to showcase Machine learning models or any python functions.

## üîë Key Features
Gradio has many important features and tools to provide the user with all means necessary to demonstrate their models or functions. Some of the key features of this library are:

# 1. Interfaces

Gradio allows us to create Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) to demonstrate Machine Learning models and other Python functions. These interfaces enable users to visualize and interact with models in real-time, which helps show all of the functionalities and capabilities of the model. Gradio helps demonstrate complex models and functions through simple interfaces, allowing both developers and non-technical users to interact and use these.

Gradio interfaces support a variety of input types, allowing users to interact with models and functions in different ways. These inputs include text fields for user input, sliders for numerical values, dropdowns and radio buttons for selecting options, checkboxes for boolean inputs, and more interactive elements like image uploaders, audio recorders, and even sketchpads for freehand drawing. The outputs are have a wide range as well from simple text responses and highlighted text to more complex outputs like images, audio playback, video rendering, and data visualizations. By combining these inputs and outputs, Gradio makes it easy to create dynamic and interactive applications. Some of these inputs have been demonstrated below in the Gradio app for a Toy Calculator.


<iframe src="https://abhisheknair-24110009-gradio-app-1.hf.space" width="100%" height="600px" style="border:none;"></iframe> 


The code snippet for the following is:

```python
import gradio as gr

def calculator(num1, operation, num2 ):
    global message
    if operation == "add":
        message= num1 + num2
    elif operation == "subtract":
        message= num1 - num2
    elif operation == "multiply":
        message= num1 * num2
    elif operation == "divide":
        if num2 == 0:
            message="Cannot divide by zero"
        else:
            message=num1 / num2
    return message

def store_message(num1,num2,operation, history: list[str]):  
    output = {
        "Result": calculator(num1,operation,num2),
        "History": history[::-1]
    }
    message=calculator(num1,operation,num2)
    history.append(f"{num1} {operation} {num2} = {message}")
    return output, history

demo = gr.Interface(fn=store_message,
                    inputs=["number",gr.Slider(value=0,minimum=-100,maximum=100),gr.Radio(["add", "subtract", "multiply", "divide"]), gr.State(value=[])],
                    outputs=["json", gr.State()],
                    title=" Toy Calculator with History",
                    description="We can save the data being executed in the toy calculator through state interfaces"
                    )

demo.launch()
```

This demonstration highlights Gradio‚Äôs ability to create interactive and accessible interfaces, making it a powerful tool for showcasing models, functions, and applications.


# 2. Blocks

Gradio blocks is a much more flexible interface builder for the gradio library. It provides the user will all the tools to edit all components of the interface. It allows developers to create multi-component applications with full control over its layout, theme, data flow etc. Blocks lets users create complex workflows, chain multiple functions together, and design custom user interactions. 
Following are two apps made to demonstrate gradio blocks:

1\. 
The app below shows an interface created using Gradio blocks for a random name generator app. It shows the sidebar function. In the app, users can select an option for the type of name that they want and continuously generate names without having to select what type of name they want again, i.e. function calls with certain conditions can be done without having to chose the condition everytime the function is called.

<iframe src="https://abhisheknair-24110009-gradio-app-6.hf.space" width="100%" height="600px" style="border:none;"></iframe>

The code snippet for the above is:

```python
import gradio as gr
import random


def generate_pet_name(animal_type, personality):
    cute_prefixes = ["Fluffy", "Ziggy", "Bubbles", "Pickle", "Waffle", "Mochi", "Cookie", "Pepper"]
    animal_suffixes = {
        "Cat": ["Whiskers", "Paws", "Mittens", "Purrington"],
        "Dog": ["Woofles", "Barkington", "Waggins", "Pawsome"],
        "Bird": ["Feathers", "Wings", "Chirpy", "Tweets"],
        "Rabbit": ["Hops", "Cottontail", "Bouncy", "Fluff"]
    }

    prefix = random.choice(cute_prefixes)
    suffix = random.choice(animal_suffixes[animal_type])

    if personality == "Silly":
        prefix = random.choice(["Sir", "Lady", "Captain", "Professor"]) + " " + prefix
    elif personality == "Royal":
        suffix += " the " + random.choice(["Great", "Magnificent", "Wise", "Brave"])

    return f"{prefix} {suffix}"


with gr.Blocks(theme=gr.themes.Soft()) as demo:
    with gr.Sidebar(position="left"):
        gr.Markdown("# üêæ Pet Name Generator")
        gr.Markdown("Use the options below to generate a unique pet name!")

        animal_type = gr.Dropdown(
            choices=["Cat", "Dog", "Bird", "Rabbit"],
            label="Choose your pet type",
            value="Cat"
        )
        personality = gr.Radio(
            choices=["Normal", "Silly", "Royal"],
            label="Personality type",
            value="Normal"
        )

    name_output = gr.Textbox(label="Your pet's fancy name:", lines=2)
    generate_btn = gr.Button("Generate Name! üé≤", variant="primary")
    generate_btn.click(
        fn=generate_pet_name,
        inputs=[animal_type, personality],
        outputs=name_output
    )

demo.launch()
```

2\.
The app below shows how history of inputs can be saved throughout a session in a Gradio app, and then be re-used in later inputs as well.

<iframe src="https://abhisheknair-24110009-gradio-app-3.hf.space" width="100%" height="600px" style="border:none;"></iframe> 

The code snippet for the above is:
```python
import gradio as gr

with gr.Blocks() as demo:

    tasks = gr.State([])  # Store tasks
    new_task = gr.Textbox(label="Task Name", autofocus=True)

    # Function to add a new task
    def add_task(tasks, new_task_name):
        return tasks + [{"name": new_task_name, "complete": False, "deleted": False}], ""

    # Submit button to add task
    new_task.submit(add_task, [tasks, new_task], [tasks, new_task])

    # Function to render tasks
    @gr.render(inputs=tasks)
    def render_todos(task_list):
        # Categorizing tasks into complete, incomplete, and deleted
        complete = [task for task in task_list if task["complete"]]
        incomplete = [task for task in task_list if not task["complete"] and not task["deleted"]]
        deleted = [task for task in task_list if task["deleted"]]

        # Rendering Incomplete Tasks
        gr.Markdown(f"### Incomplete Tasks ({len(incomplete)})")
        for task in incomplete:
            with gr.Row():
                gr.Textbox(task['name'], show_label=False, container=False)
                done_btn = gr.Button("Done", scale=0)
                
                # Mark task as complete
                def mark_done(task=task):
                    task["complete"] = True
                    return task_list
                
                done_btn.click(mark_done, None, [tasks])

                delete_btn = gr.Button("Delete", scale=0, variant="stop")
                
                # Mark task as deleted
                def delete(task=task):
                    task["deleted"] = True
                    return task_list
                
                delete_btn.click(delete, None, [tasks])

        # Rendering Complete Tasks
        gr.Markdown(f"### Complete Tasks ({len(complete)})")
        for task in complete:
            gr.Textbox(task['name'], show_label=False, container=False)

        # Rendering Deleted Tasks
        gr.Markdown(f"### Deleted Tasks ({len(deleted)})")
        for task in deleted:
            gr.Textbox(task['name'], show_label=False, container=False)

# Launch the Gradio interface
demo.launch()
```

# 3. Chatbot

Gradio makes it easy to build and deploy chatbots by providing interactive interfaces for handling user input and generating responses in real-time. With support for text-based inputs and outputs, chatbots can process user messages and return AI-generated responses instantly. 
Using Gradio, chatbots can be integrated with a wide range of AI and machine learning models. Developers can connect chatbots with different AI or Machine Learning models and create an interactive interface for them through Gradio. Gradio‚Äôs support for multiple input types allows users to interact via text, voice, or even images, making chatbots more versatile. Whether for customer support, virtual assistants, or AI-powered conversation models, Gradio provides a simple yet powerful framework for developing engaging chatbot experiences.

Below is a simple chatbot interface for an AI model.


<iframe src="https://abhisheknair-24110009-gradio-app-2.hf.space" width="100%" height="600px" style="border:none;"></iframe> 

The code snippet for the following is:
```python
import gradio as gr

# Function to generate chatbot response and returns chat history
def chatbot(input_text, chat_history):
    response = f"Bot: {input_text[::-1]}"
    
    chat_history.append((input_text, response))
    
    return chat_history, response


with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    chat_history = gr.State([])
    
    user_input = gr.Textbox(label="Your Message", placeholder="Type here...")
    
    bot_response = gr.Textbox(label="Bot Response", interactive=True)
    
    submit_button = gr.Button("Send")
    
    submit_button.click(
        chatbot, 
        inputs=[user_input, chat_history], 
        outputs=[chat_history, bot_response]
    )


# Launching the interface
demo.launch()
```

# 4. Data Science and Plots

Gradio enables interactive data science interfaces by allowing users to visualize and manipulate data in real-time, making trend analysis and model interpretation more intuitive. By integrating interactive inputs such as sliders, dropdowns, and text fields, users can dynamically adjust parameters and instantly see how changes affect graphs, predictions, or statistical outputs. Gradio supports real-time data visualization through libraries like Matplotlib, Plotly, and Seaborn, enabling users to explore datasets, observe trends, and compare results interactively. This helps users obtain results and interpret trends in data instantaneously, without having to wait/create separate programs for different cases.


1\. Below is a demonstration on how Gradio interfaces can be used to get live updates on trends. The app shows how different input methods can make graps more interactive and how trend changes can be analyzed through this. The app allows users to visualise how sine waves change by changing parameters such as the amplitude and frequency.


<iframe src="https://abhisheknair-24110009-gradio-app-4.hf.space" width="100%" height="600px" style="border:none;"></iframe> 

The code snippet for the above app is:
```python
import gradio as gr
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# (1) Function to Generate Plot Based on User Input
def plot_function(amplitude, frequency):
    """
    Generates a sine wave plot based on user-selected amplitude and frequency.
    """
    x = np.linspace(0, 10, 400)  # (2) X-axis values
    y = amplitude * np.sin(frequency * x)  # (3) Compute Y values for sine wave

    # (4) Create the plot
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    ax.plot(x, y, label=f"Amp: {amplitude}, Freq: {frequency}")
    ax.legend()
    ax.set_xlabel("Time")
    ax.set_ylabel("Amplitude")
    ax.set_title("Sine Wave Plot")

    return fig  # (5) Return the generated plot

# (6) Creating Interactive Gradio Interface
plot_interface = gr.Interface(
    fn=plot_function,  # (7) Connect function to UI
    inputs=[
        gr.Slider(1, 10, value=5, label="Amplitude"),  # (8) Amplitude Slider
        gr.Slider(1, 10, value=2, label="Frequency")   # (9) Frequency Slider
    ],
    outputs=gr.Plot(),  # (10) Output as a Plot
    live=True  # (11) Updates the plot in real time
)

# (12) Launch the interface
plot_interface.launch()
```

2\. The app below shows how changes in itrends can be visualised through Gradio interfaces. This shows it's real life applications as much larger datasets and much more complicated computations can be carried out and displayed through similar interfaces.

<iframe src="https://abhisheknair-24110009-gradio-app-5.hf.space" width="100%" height="600px" style="border:none;"></iframe>

The code snippet for the above app is:

```python
import gradio as gr
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Sample DataFrame with Age, Weight, and Height
# You can replace this with your actual data or load it from a CSV file
data = {
    'age': np.random.randint(18, 65, 100),
    'weight': np.random.uniform(50, 100, 100),
    'height': np.random.uniform(150, 190, 100)
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Gradio Dashboard
with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    with gr.Row():
        # Inputs for age filter
        min_age = gr.Slider(minimum=18, maximum=65, step=1, value=18, label="Min Age")
        max_age = gr.Slider(minimum=18, maximum=65, step=1, value=65, label="Max Age")
    
    # Filtered DataFrame Function
    def filtered_df(min_age, max_age):
        filtered_data = df[(df['age'] >= min_age) & (df['age'] <= max_age)]
        return filtered_data

    # Scatter plot between Age and Weight
    gr.ScatterPlot(
        filtered_df, 
        inputs=[min_age, max_age], 
        x="age", 
        y="weight", 
        title="Age vs Weight", 
        color="height",  # Color points by height to add more dimension
        show_legend=True
    )

    # Line plot between Age and Height
    gr.LinePlot(
        filtered_df, 
        inputs=[min_age, max_age], 
        x="age", 
        y="height", 
        title="Age vs Height"
    )

demo.launch()
